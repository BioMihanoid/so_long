The idea is to create a 2D game with the help of the minilibX and X11 graphic server. The player has to collect the "collectibles" before he can leave the map through the exit(s). The map is a file ".ber" loaded as an argument of the executable. The number of moves are counted and the goal is to join the exit with the minimum number of moves.
